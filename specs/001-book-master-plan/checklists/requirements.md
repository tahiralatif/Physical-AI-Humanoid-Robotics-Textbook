# Specification Quality Checklist: Book Master Plan - Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-12-06
**Feature**: [Link to spec.md](../../specs/001-book-master-plan/spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/sp.clarify` or `/sp.plan`
- **Deviation Note**: The "UI/UX Requirements – HIGH STANDARD" section contains implementation-specific details (e.g., React Three Fiber, glassmorphism, Algolia DocSearch). While detailed, these are presented as explicit UI/UX requirements provided by the user and are within a dedicated section, so the spec is deemed acceptable for progression to planning.
