## Prompt

read my specification and create plan and also add we use uv packages manager to initialize our backend project

## Response snapshot

It seems I'm not on a feature branch, which is required for the `/sp.plan` command. My current branch is `features`, but it expects a name like `001-feature-name`.

Would you like me to create a new feature branch (e.g., `001-initial-feature`) and switch to it, or would you prefer to proceed on the `features` branch and specify a feature name for the plan (e.g., `initial-feature`)?

In the meantime, I will create a Prompt History Record for this interaction.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Not able to proceed with plan creation due to branch naming convention.
- 🧪 Tests: N/A
- 📁 Files: No files modified.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Awaiting user's decision on branch and feature name.
- 🧠 Reflection: Need to handle branch naming convention before proceeding with planning workflow.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: `setup-plan.sh` script failed due to incorrect branch name.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Ask user for clarification on branch name or create a new branch.
