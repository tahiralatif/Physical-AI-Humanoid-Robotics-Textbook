# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics: Course Overview

Welcome to the 13-week intensive course on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** designed for industry practitioners.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with embodied systems — robots that interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in digital spaces, Physical AI must:

- Process sensor data from cameras, LIDAR, IMUs
- Control actuators and motors in real-time
- Navigate dynamic, unpredictable environments
- Make decisions that affect the physical world

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into **4 major modules** spanning **13 weeks**:

### Introduction (Weeks 1-2)
Foundation in Physical AI concepts, robotics frameworks, and course roadmap.

### Module 1: ROS 2 - Robot Operating System (Weeks 3-5)
- **Week 3**: ROS 2 Fundamentals - Nodes, Topics, Services
- **Week 4**: Communication Patterns - Publishers, Subscribers, Actions
- **Week 5**: Advanced ROS 2 - Parameters, Launch Files, Lifecycle Nodes

### Module 2: Digital Twin with Gazebo (Weeks 6-7)
- **Week 6**: Gazebo Simulation Basics
- **Week 7**: URDF Modeling and Simulation

### Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Platform (Weeks 8-10)
- **Week 8**: Isaac Sim Introduction
- **Week 9**: Perception Systems
- **Week 10**: Manipulation and Planning

### Module 4: VLA & Humanoid Robotics (Weeks 11-13)
- **Week 11**: Vision-Language-Action Models
- **Week 12**: Humanoid Robot Basics
- **Week 13**: Full System Integration

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. **Design and implement** ROS 2 applications for robotic systems
2. **Create digital twins** of robots using Gazebo and URDF
3. **Deploy perception systems** using NVIDIA Isaac platform
4. **Integrate VLA models** for intelligent robot control
5. **Build end-to-end** humanoid robot applications

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: Intermediate level (classes, async/await, decorators)
- **Linux**: Basic terminal navigation (optional but helpful)
- **Math**: Linear algebra basics (vectors, matrices)

## Hardware Options

You can complete this course using any of these setups:

1. **Digital Twin Workstation**: RTX 3060+ GPU, Ubuntu 22.04
2. **Edge Kit**: NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano
3. **Cloud-Native**: AWS/Azure with GPU instances

## Course Philosophy

This course emphasizes:

- **Hands-on learning**: Every concept includes practical exercises
- **Industry relevance**: Real-world scenarios and production patterns
- **AI-native approach**: RAG chatbot assists your learning journey
